          <p>
            The majority of my professional development has been done
            using the Sencha ExtJS framework. I've used ExtJS to help create,
            update, and maintain several large scale financial modeling web
            applications for the US Navy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Occasionally, I've used HTML4, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery,
            React, and several plug ins and other frameworks, however, these
            have generally been used for personal projects or as learning
            opportunities.

          <p>
            Almost all of my back end development experience has been with
            ColdFusion 9, 10, and 11. I have dabbeled in PHP and Node.js in my
            spare time as well. My experience with ColdFusion has taught me a
            lot about CRUD processes, data manipulation, data migration, data
            storage, and optimization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Professionally, my responsibilities often involve the creation of
            both the front end and back end portions of an application,
            allowing me to become very familiar with the communication that
            takes place between both sides.

          <p class="h3">Database</p>
          <p>
            The bulk of my database experince is with MSSQL, though I do have
            some experience using MySQL and Oracle.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been responsible for creating, modifying, updating and
            deleting data using SQL, creating indexes, creating synonyms,
            creating views, and updating stored procedures. Much of this has
            been done using ORM with ColdFusion, though occationally changes
            have needed to be done directly in MSSQL itself.

          <p>
            Thanks to the relatively small size of my current office, I've
            had the opportunity to learn many skills performed by other team
            members I work closely with.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been responsible for gathering and documenting customer
            requirements, creating software requirements specifications
            and system design documents, creating and assigning tasks in Jira,
            creating estimates for tasks, documenting processes (often
            using Confluence), QA testing, developing QA test cases, code/peer
            reviewing teammate's code, and creating and promoting builds using
            Jenkins.

          <p>
            For roughly 3 years I worked at a large call center providing
            teirs 1, 2, and 3 tech support for the Navy and Marine Corps. My
            time there allowed me to learn a lot about customer service, as
            well as, troubleshooting network, file server, print server, exchange
            server, OS, hardware, and various software issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            This time on the helpdesk also allowed me the ability to learn how
            to automate processes using Batch scripts and create small
            applications using Batch files and VBS.
