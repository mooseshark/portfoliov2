          <p class="h3">Front End Development</p>
          <p>
            I have extensive experience with modern JavaScript. The majority of
            my framework experience has been with Sencha's ExtJS framework,
            however, I've dabbled with AngularJS and Vue.js, which this site is
            built with, just not in a professional setting. I also have some
            experience with some front end development using C# for desktop
            application development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of JavaScript and those specific frameworks, I also have
            front end experience with HTML, CSS, jQuery, TypeScript, ColdFusion
            and Socket.IO. I've also done a few tutorials with React in the past.
            In my experience, most JavaScript based frameworks have been fairly
            similar, which makes them easier to pick up and switch between for me.

          <p class="h3">Back End Development</p>
          <p>
            Professionally, my experience is split between (more recently) Ruby on Rails
            and ColdFusion and ColdSpring, which is somewhat similar to Java and
            the Java Spring Framework, as ColdFusion was built using Java. I've
            also used C# with the Entity Framework for backend development on
            several desktop applications. I've done some PHP, but not recently.
          </p>
          <p>
            More recently, I've been spending a lot of time with  Angular
            Apollo and Vue Apollo, and utilizing Apollo to connect to GraphQL
            APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The majority of my backend design has been utilizing CRUD design
            methodologies, but I am familiar with REST as well. I have researched
            SOAP before, but have yet to use SOAP design methods with any
            projects, personally or professionally.

          <i class="fas fa-database fa-4x"></i>
          <p class="h3">Database</p>
          <p>
            The bulk of my database experience is with PostgreSQL, MSSQL and SQLite, though
            I do have some experience using MySQL and Oracle.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been responsible for creating, modifying, updating and
            deleting data using SQL, as well as creating and updating indexes,
            synonyms, views, and stored procedures. Much of this has
            been done using Rails, ORM with ColdFusion or Entity Framework, however
            I've also had to accomplish much of this with normal SQL.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm familiar with NoSQL databases and JSON stores as well. I've
            used MongoDB a few times for personal projects, but have not used it
            in a professional setting or with a large amount of data as of yet.

          <p>
            In the past I've done some very minor work with C, C++, and Java,
            though my experience with these languages is very minimal and at a
            more introductory level.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a much more extensive history with writing batch scripts,
            having used batch scripting frequently at my help desk job to automate
            tasks, automate application repairs, and create random fixes to help speed
            up some aspects of my job. I've also used batch scripting along with
            VBS to implement some simple tools with a .hta GUI.
          </p>
          <p>
            At my previous job I was able to work with PowerShell to automate
            a few tasks and CSScript to write some database and code fixes for
            our applications there.

          <p>
            Thanks to my background with computers and IT support, I have a
            skill set that ranges beyond that of just a developer. I have been
            responsible for troubleshooting, implementing and testing new hardware
            and software on Windows and Linux systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            When not coding, I've been responsible for gathering and documenting customer
            requirements, creating software requirements specifications
            and system design documents, creating and assigning tasks and stories in Jira,
            development sprints, creating estimates for tasks, documenting processes (often
            using Confluence), QA testing, developing QA test cases, code/peer
            reviewing teammate's code, and creating and promoting builds. As a lead,
            I was also in charge of planning future releases and features, as well as
            determining priority of tasks/stories for sprints.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have some experience with DevOps responsibilities like AWS administration
            and creating build processes with Jenkins, however these experiences
            are limited in comparison to many of my other responsibilities.

          <p class="h3">Customer Support</p>
          <p>
            For roughly 3 years I worked at a large call center providing
            tier 3 tech support for the Navy and Marine Corps. I often
            was responsible for deriving problems from customer descriptions,
            notating and resolving the customer's problems, and ensuring they were
            satisfied with the result. Occasionally I was responsible for
            de-escalating situations and providing customers with confidence that
            their issues would be resolved.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a project lead, I was responsible for correspondence with
            our customers. I would capture meeting notes and help narrow
            down requirements and priority of requirements, as well as
            provide progress updates for them and receive feedback that I
            could relay to my team and coworkers to help us with the
            development process.
